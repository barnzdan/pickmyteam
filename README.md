# PickMyTeam - Teams for the Indecisive

A public repository for the NFL team picking side project: http://pickmyteam.name

The goal of this project was to come up with an extremely simple infrastructure in AWS to create a random NFL Team selection app. There were initially 3 objectives for this:

1. Keep it simple
2. Keep it cheap
3. Use a combination of Lambda, S3, API Gateway and Route 53
